	<span class="text-[#383838]" slot="paragraph">
		Clarineta and Violia grew up as harmonious sisters, their music once flowing in perfect duet
		across the land. But when their parents separated, the harmony broke. Clarineta was sent to live
		in Harmony Town, a lush, vibrant forest. In contrast, Violia found herself in Dissonance Town, a
		desolate volcanic wasteland, where the sky hung heavy with ash and the ground cracked under the
		pressure of resentment and silence.

		Clarineta runs into Piaru, who is a nice an outgoing person that plays positive, harmonious
		compositions. Clarineta feels inspired by his work and decides to join him, and they both create
		excellent music together. This helps keep the universe of Pianotopia peaceful throughout the
		day. They create an Alliance called the Harmonic Accord.

		However, this news spreads to Violia, who becomes very jealous about her sister's
		accomplishments. She gets upset and decides to roam the streets, where she runs into Bassoonia,
		who is also jealous of Piaru's successes because she used to make much better music than Piaru
		before the Harmonic Accord crushed her musical career. Together, they decided to sabotage the
		success of the Harmonic Accord by playing screeching and eerie sounds whenever they would play.

	<span class="text-[#383838]" slot="paragraph">
		Auralis Loopwright grew up surrounded by music, much like Piaru. From a young age, she was
		fascinated by how sounds layered together and how a simple beat could grow into something much
		bigger. She spent hours experimenting with old instruments and learning to loop sounds, creating
		rhythms that were unique and hard to replicate. Unlike some gifted prodigies, she’s just someone
		who loves trying new things and isn’t afraid to keep working until it sounds right. Over time,
		she developed her own style by blending natural sounds with electronic beats, making music that
		feels alive and connected to the world around her. In Pianotopia, where Piaru uses his piano
		harmonies to fight against evil, Auralis uses her looping skills to support him and others. Her
		soundscapes can calm allies, confuse enemies, or give a burst of energy when needed. Together,
		their music forms a powerful harmony against the darkness that threatens their land. Auralis is
		practical and grounded, a bit of a perfectionist, always refining her craft. She doesn’t believe
		in grand destinies, but she knows her passion for music has real power—and she’s determined to
		use it to help protect their home.

	<span class="text-[#383838]" slot="paragraph">
		Whenever the Harmonic Accord for Pianotopia, many of the locals started to hate their music
		because of its horrible sounds. The creation of Rhythm-9 was created through Piaru's father
		being an engineer - they both used their musical and conceptual knowledge into creating their
		product.

	<span class="text-durple text-[24px]" slot="heading">Ferma The Peacemaker</span>
	<span class="text-[#383838]" slot="paragraph">
		Ferma was known around the world as the Peacemaker of Music. He wasn’t just a leader, he was the
		one people trusted to keep things calm and fair in the world of sound. For years, he settled
		disputes between sound groups and made sure no one used dangerous audio tech to cause harm. To
		Ferma, music was meant to bring people together, not tear them apart. He didn’t believe in
		fighting unless there was no other choice. Most of the time, he kept the peace by talking things
		through and using his deep knowledge of how sound works. But Rhythm-9 was something else. It was
		powerful, unpredictable, and risky. When Ferma found out that Piaru had activated it, he knew it
		couldn’t be ignored. He didn’t want a fight but he couldn’t sit back and do nothing. He had to
		step in and not to shut Piaru down completely, but to make sure the damage didn’t spread.

	<span class="text-[#383838]" slot="paragraph">
		Through their combined efforts, Piaru, Auralis Loopwright, Rhythm 9, and Voxwell Ferma were able
		to defeat Violia and Bassoonia. Each of them brought something vital to the battle—Piaru’s
		harmonies, Auralis’s healing loops, Rhythm 9’s tempo manipulation, and Voxwell’s voice control.
		Together, their music overwhelmed the dissonance of their enemies and restored balance to
		Pianotopia.
